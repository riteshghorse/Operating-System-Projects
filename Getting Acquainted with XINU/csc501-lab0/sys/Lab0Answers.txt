1. Assuming the XINU text begins at address 0x0, draw a rough diagram of XINU's memory layout with addresses derived from your experimental measurements. Include the information you uncovered from running your version of printsegaddress() and printprocstks().

-------------------- 0x00000000
|		   |
------etext--------- 0x0001924d
|		   |
------edata--------- 0x0001e53d
|		   |
------end----------- 0x0002ff78
|		   |
------heap----------
|		   |
------limit--------- 0x00fff000
|		   |
|     len: 4096	   |
|		   |
------stack base---- 0x00fffffc


2. What is the difference in stack top address before and after calling printtos()? Draw a diagram to illustrate what are the contents of the items pushed into the stack between these two time points.
Solution:
Difference between stack top address before and after:
	before		: 0x00ffeff4
	after		: 0x00ffefec
	difference	: 8 bytes

Diagram:

	        --------------------
		|return address	   |
	        --------------------


3. In a stack frame, local variables are stored below the top of the stack. In task 3, does your result show all the local variables declared in your printtos function? If not, can you explain that? (hint: try to disable the compiler optimization by specifing -O0 in your Makefile)
Solution:
Answer:
No. The compiler optimization step does not allocate the stack memory for the local variables. It analyzes the code and assign available registers to the local variables.
